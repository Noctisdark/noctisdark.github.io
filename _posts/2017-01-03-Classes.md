Hey, this time I'll be presenting something relatively simple. It's, wait for it.. *Classes*.
You have probably guessed that when you were reading the title of this [post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post).
Anyways let's get our hands dirty.

## Classes in ES5-:

Making a class in ES5- is a pain and somewhat unintuitive, but rewarding in a sense that you get to harness the power
of Javascript and understand what's happening under the hood.

#### Constructors:

The idea of a [constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor) is relatively straighforward, it's just a function that will
be called to construct your new object. In javascript, a constructor is any function that happens to
exist after the `new` keyword.

Making an `Animal` constructor goes like this:

```javascript
function Animal(name, owner, sound) {
	this.name = name;
	this.owner = owner;
	this.sound = sound;
};

var frog = new Animal('Froggy', 'Leonhardo', 'Croack!');
```

If you never seen this code before, `new Animal(...)` will return an object having `name`, `owner` and `sound` properties.
This new object, `Frog` in our case, is called an instance of the `Animal` class.

*Spoiler Alert 1*: Even though `Animal` is just a function, Javascript programmers tend to call it a `class`,
because it's enough to have it to make any `Animal` object.

*Spoiler Alert 2*: If you haven't already guessed what `this` refers to, it points to the new object being constructed.
Used a function as a constructor bind the `this` keyword automatically to the new instance of the class.
<hr/>
#### Prototypes:

You might have guessed it by now, having an animal that knows his `name`, `owner` and `sound` is pretty boring
if this guy can't do anything useful with it. So, let's make the `Animal`s `speak`.

We can actually do two things:
##### Strategy N째1:
```javascript
function Animal(name, owner, sound) {
	/*Previous code*/
	
	this.speak = function() {
		console.log(this.sound);
	}
};

var frog = new Animal('Froggy', 'Leonhardo', 'Croack!');
frog.speak(); //Croack!
```

We are adding a `speak` property in the constructor and this is actually a bad practice. Because now, every instance of
the `Animal` class will have this property and thus eating much more memory and because it's actully not doing anything useful.

If all `Animal`s could speak the same way, why not make this `speak` function shared between all animals. That's exactly the point of prototypes.

##### Strategy N째2:
*Spoiler Alert*: **The** Prefered one.

```javascript
function Animal(name, owner, sound) {
	/*Previous code*/
};

Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
	console.log(this.sound);	
};

var frog = new Animal('Froggy', 'Leonhardo', 'Croack!');
frog.speak(); //Croack!
```
I hope it's all clear now. Having a property of the prototype of a `class` makes it shared between all instance of that class,
if one instance changes it, it is changed for all.
<hr/>
#### Inheritance:

Now, let's make a `Dog`. A `Dog` is an `Animal`, so we better play this well and let it inherit from the `Animal` class.
After all, the dog must have some thing in common with other animals.

*Spoiler Alert*: I am not [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin).

```javascript
/*Previous code*/

Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype); //Inherit all shared stuff from animals

function Dog(name, owner) {
	Animal.call(this, name, owner, 'Bark!'); //Make this an animal first
	this.isCute = true; //All dogs are cute, right ?
};
var doggy = new Dog('John', 'Clark');
doggy.speak(); //Bark!
console.log(this.isCute); //true
```
And it's as easy as that. You inherit the `Superclass.prototype` using `Object.create` and in your `Subclass` constructor,
you call the `Superclass constructor` on the object you are making.

##### What is Object.create ?

It's simply a function that creates a new object, based on the prototype specified in the first argument, owning the properties specified in the rest of the arguments.
Just to make life easier, think of it like this:

```javascript
Object.prototype = function(proto) {
	return {__proto__: proto};
}
```
I highly recommand this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create) if you want to learn more.

And Taadaa, you've just learnt one of the most important concepts in Javascript and OOP: [Prototype Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain). That wasn't hard at all, wasn't it ?
<hr/>
#### Static variables:

Static variables are properties of the class itself rather than an instance property.
If we want to write a function to get the owner of the pet we have, we can do one of these two things:

##### Strategy N째1:
```javascript
Animal.prototype.getOwner = function() {
	return this.owner;
};
```

*Sarcasm: This will only work if an `Animal` really knows his owner, but in Javascript it does.*

getOwner is a property of all instances coming from the `Animal` class,  `Dogs`,  `Cats`, etc.. and they all get to know their owner.

##### Strategy N째2:
```javascript
Animal.getOwner = function(pet) {
	return pet.owner;
};
```

Now, getOwner is a property of the class itself. and won't be found on any instance of that class. and that's what we call a *static method* or a *static function*.
Think of `Animal.getOwner` as the factory that creates `Animal`s, even if the animal doesn't know his owner, they factory could. And that's what *static variables* are all about.
<hr/>
### Classes in ES6:

Since ES6, classes are easier to understand and a lot simpler to work with.
Let me prove this by just rewriting the old examples one by one, without changing a bit or a byte.

#### Constructors:

```javascript
class Animal {
	constructor(name, owner, sound) {
		this.name = name;
		this.owner = owner;
		this.sound = sound;
	}

	speak() {
		console.log(this.sound);
	}
};

var frog = new Animal('Froggy', 'FrogLover', 'Croack!');
frog.speak();
```

*Note: constructor is the function that get invoked when creating the new object, just like the `Animal` in `new Animal;` from the example before*
<hr/>
#### Inheritance:

```javascript
class Dog extends Animal {
	constructor(name, owner) {
		super(name, owner, 'Bark!');
		this.isCute = true:
	}
};

var doggy = new Dog('John', 'Clark');
doggy.speak(); //Bark!
console.log(doggy.isCute); //true
```
That was really cute.
*Note: super is a method that *must* be invoked the constructor of the `Subclass`, it's basically the `Superclass` constructor*.
*In this case, it's `Animal`.*
<hr/>
#### Static functions:

```javascript
class Animal {
	/*Code from before*/

	static getOwner(pet) {
		return pet.owner;
	}
};
```
That was a piece of cake, wasn't it ?
<hr/>

And all there is to it.

Despite their awesomeness, ES6 is not yet supported in all browsers, always check [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) for comptability.

Solutions exist, the best I know of is [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) which transpiles your ES6 code to ES5 that all decent browsers can understand.

**Epilogue:**
This is how another article ends, you have probably used 5 or 10 minutes of your life to read this. I really appreciate it. if you liked this post of learnt something new from it. *please* leave a comment and share your ideas. Thanks a lot and good luck ! :D
