Hello world, this is my very first blog-post and I am very excited about it.
This is how it going to be:

1. Introduction
2. The Blog
3. What I'll be posting about
4. Epilogue

# Introduction

### Who Am I
Hey, my name is *Noctisdark*. It's a very nice and evil pseudoname that attemps to completely shadow the person
behind it.

I spend the days of my life trying to be a **Programmer** and I am struggling. *Yeah I know, life is so hard*.<br/>
I programmed in many languages before and learnt a handful of things that I want to share, so get ready
this new kind awesomeness.

### Interests:
I am Interested in __You__, [Food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food), [Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music)
and particulary [Metal](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal). Best Bands include [Skillet](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skillet),
[I Exist](http://www.iexistband.com/main.html) and [Thousand Foot Krutch](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Foot_Krutch).

I am also interested in [Design](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design), [Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy)
and exceptionally [Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics).

# The Blog
The blog is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), served using
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Jekyll is a great static website generator that takes your [Markdown](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files and transforms
them to [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) files.<br/>
These files can then be fed to your favourite, *not necessaraly though*, [Web Brouwser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) to produce
the shit that we call the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). It actually does a lot more than just this, but you get it.

The theme used is called [Type Theme](https://rohanchandra.github.io/project/type/), an [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)
theme for Jekyll. I picked it because It's a very *Nice & Responsive* theme and that is something you
don't get to see everyday.

# What I'll be posting about
What an embarrassing question, I really didn't thought a lot about it. I was like __Make a blog It's awesome__.

And yes, I'll primary be posting about [Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming) and [Game Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_physics).<br/>
And maybe, just maybe, I'll share with you how I became [Immortal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal) and a bunch of [Wikipedia Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia). 

# Epilogue
And that's all Folks. I hope you like, I hope you find it interesting and I hope you'll be following
along.

I'll integrate Disqus as soon as possible so we can get in touch.
